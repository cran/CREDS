\description{
Population ratio estimator under two-phase random sampling design has gained enormous popularity in present era. This package provides functions for estimation calibrated population ratio under two phase sampling design, including the approximate variance of the ratio estimator. The improved ratio estimator can be applicable for both the case, when auxiliary data is available at unit level or aggregate level for first phase sampled. Calibration weight of each unit of the second phase sample was calculated. Single and combined inclusion probabilities were also estimated for both phases under two phase random sampling. The improved ratio estimator's percentage coefficient of variation was also determined as a measure of accuracy.
